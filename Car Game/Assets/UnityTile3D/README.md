## Todo
- Improve Palette / Painting tools, particularily with rotation / flipping
- Add Slopes, or perhaps variations on the kinds of "blocks" you can place
- Look into using Sprites since Unity seems to have a way to split up a texture automatically already
- Separate into multiple meshes as the terrain grows (probably create child gameplay objects?)
- Optimizations (ex. don't rebuild the collision mesh if we're just painting, etc)
- Add Undo / Redo
